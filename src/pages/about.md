Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I craft elegant iOS experiences by day and explore the frontiers of AI by night. As a two-time Apple Swift Student Challenge winner (WWDC'20 & '21) and Senior Software Engineer, I blend the art of intuitive mobile interfaces with the science of intelligent systems.

Currently pursuing Applied Data Science at San Jose State University, I'm on a mission to bridge the gap between mobile innovation and artificial intelligence. My work spans from building production-ready iOS apps with Swift and SwiftUI to developing AI agents.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me leading the Swift Hyderabad Community, organising at tech conferences, or mentoring the next generation of developers. I believe in the power of community-driven development and open source collaboration.

## Recent Launches ðŸš€

**DEW** - A mindfulness app crafted with SwiftUI and CoreData, featuring religious decks and home screen widgets that bring daily inspiration to thousands of users.

**Feebac** - A Flutter-powered news platform where technology meets rewards, engaging users through surveys while maintaining clean architecture across 23,000+ lines of code.

## Tech Stack

I specialize in building iOS applications with Swift and SwiftUI, but my toolkit extends far beyond. From Flutter for cross-platform development to Python for AI research, I choose the right tool for each unique challenge.

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of mobile and AI technology. Whether you're looking to build something amazing or just want to chat about the latest in tech, drop me a line:
